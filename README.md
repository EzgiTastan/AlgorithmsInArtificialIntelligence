# Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the "Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence" repository! This repository is designed to help myself whenever I need to remember the common algorithms used in artificial intelligence applications. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to provide resources and implementations to enhance your understanding of AI algorithms.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide explanations of fundamental AI algorithms (Do not forget to check the _breathtaking_ comments of mine.).
- Offer resources for studying each algorithm, including articles, tutorials, and academic papers (This repo will be updated regularly).
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from the community to improve the content and add new algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Algorithms**: Explore the list of algorithms available in this repository. Each algorithm is organized into its own directory.
2. **Study Materials**: Check the `README.md` file in each algorithm directory for an overview of the algorithm, its applications, and resources for further study.
3. **Implementation**: Review the Python code provided for each algorithm to understand its implementation details.
4. **Contribute**: If you have additional resources, optimizations, or new algorithms to add, feel free to contribute by opening a pull request.
